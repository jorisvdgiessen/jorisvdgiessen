## Hi there, I'm Joris ðŸ‘‹

I am a junior dealer working in fixed income (govvies). I graduated as an applied mathematician majoring in quantitative finance. In my spare time, I like to play around creating small coding projects in the realm of quant finance, or reading and writing about finance, with a particular focus on fixed income problems.
